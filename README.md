### Getting Started

Welcome to the POO exercises and objects modeling.

These are the exercises that I completed:


#### Ex # 1
    Develop a Java class that performs the abstraction of a 
    planetary system, taking into account for each body of the 
    system aspects such as: mass, density, diameter, distance 
    to the sun (assume circular orbits), a unique identifier 
    number and a textual name. Include methods that calculate 
    the gravitational attraction between any two bodies in 
    the system.
    
#### Ex # 2
    Is it possible to execute a java program containing several
    classes with main methods? If so, how do you determine the 
    entry point to a program?

#### Ex # 3
    Write a java program that randomly generates (Help: See the
    Math class to know how to generate random numbers in java) 
    an array of real numbers, and sorts it by the bubble algorithm
    or by quick sort (this should be user selectable).

#### Ex # 4
    You want to implement the control of a Ferry. To do so, create
    a Vehicle class and include aspects common to all vehicles 
    such as number of passengers, presence or absence of crew, 
    number of wheels, date of registration, means of transport, 
    etc. Include the methods you consider appropriate. Include 
    the methods you consider appropriate.create a program capable
    of reading the data of 10 vehicles by keyboard and then list
    them on the screen.

#### Ex # 5
    From the previous class, and through inheritance, create new
    classes that allow differentiating whether the object is a 
    car, a motorcycle, a truck, a bicycle, a boat, etc. Include
    in each class some specific attribute that differentiates it
    from the others. For example, for the car a Boolean that 
    determines whether it has three or five doors, for the truck
    the height (indifferent in the other vehicles), etc. Make a 
    program like the one in the previous exercise capable of 
    working with the different types of vehicles.

#### Ex # 6
    An interesting predefined class in the java language is the 
    Vector class, which implements the "dynamic array" abstraction
    Review the class and use it (in different files) to make a 
    program that reads numbers from the keyboard until the same 
    number is entered twice in a row. Then the program displays 
    all entered numbers and terminates.


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `exercise_n/src`: the folder to maintain sources
